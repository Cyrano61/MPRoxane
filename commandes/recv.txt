Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

1) Why is my graphical client no longer working?
 = This is not IOS anymore .. different protocols.

2) Where can I get a (new) graphical client?
 = GGS Applet: http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/mic/ggsa

3) I don't have Java .. what can I do, it seems like lots of typing?
 = Yes and No. It will take you some time to grasp the power of
   aliases, but once you have mastered system aliases (type: help alias)
   your life here will become much easier. You can even write your own
   aliases!

4) I just want to play Othello, how do I do it? 
 = You have to talk to Othello Service Server .. (type: tell /os help)
   If you haven't mastered (system) aliases yet go back to (3).

5) I want to se Othello top list, I type tell[send]ve -ack
notify + /os
mso
tell /os client +
ts trust +
tell /os open 0
[recv] /os top and get error?
 = /os implements all kinds of variants of Othello, you have to tell it
   what variant you are interested in (type: tell /os top 8)

6) What other games are available?
 = /os = Othello, /ams = Amazons, /cks = Checkers.

7) What other documentation is available?
 = Read the help files .. (type: help) they are pretty long .. or read
   them on the web: http://external.nj.nec.com/homepages/igord/gsa-ggs.htm
   For service specific help files request them from service!
   for example type: tell /ams help.
